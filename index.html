    <h2 style="color:gold;"> My Favorite Dessert</h2>
    <p id="aqua">I have many favorite desserts, but one that I really like is Baked Alaska. I ate it when my family and I went on a cruise ship. We were having dinner in one of the more fancy resturants in the cruise ship, and I saw Baked Alaska as one of the dessert items. I had no idea what it was, but the descrpition sounded good, so I decided to try it. It was the best thing I have ever tasted! I can try to describe it to you, but I won't do it justice. So here's a picture instead.
